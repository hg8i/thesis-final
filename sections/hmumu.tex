\chapter{Higgs Decays to Two Muons}\label{sec:hmumu}


The joint observation of the Higgs boson by ATLAS \cite{atlashiggs} and CMS \cite{cmshiggs} in 2012 initiated an era of studies of this particle and its interactions.
One of the reasons that the Higgs boson is interesting is that the Englert-Brout-Higgs (BEH) mechanism generates the mass of fermions by means of Yukawa couplings to the Higgs boson.
The most direct way to study these couplings is through the fermionic decay of the Higgs, described in Section \ref{sec:phenoHiggs}.
As the fermion branching ratios given Equation \ref{eqn:higgsDecayFermions} indicate, the Yukawa coupling is proportional to the fermion mass squared.
The $H\to\ttbar$ decay is kinematically forbidden because the top quark mass, $m_t\approx173$~GeV, exceeds the mass of the Higgs boson.
Consequently, the most probable decay path is to bottom quark pairs due to their large mass $m_b=4.2$~GeV. 
Despite this, the $H\ttbar$ coupling can be measured through the ttH process described in Table \ref{tab:higgsProdDiagrams}.
The $Hb\bbar$ coupling was observed at the ATLAS experiment using the VH production channels \cite{atlasHbb}.
The next most massive fermion after the bottom quark is the tau lepton, with $m_\tau=1.8$~GeV, which has been studied by ATLAS \cite{atlasTauTau} and CMS \cite{cmsTauTau}.
% I don't want the thesis to be immediately out of date
Although the charm quark with follows with a mass $m_c=1.3$~GeV, the messy hadronization of final state proves difficult to identify and study.
Searches for $H\to c\cbar$ remain insensitive even to $Hc\cbar$ couplings $\sim100$ times the Standard Model expectation.
This leaves the muon and the $H\mm$ coupling, where the muon's mass of $\m_\mu=0.1$~GeV results in a challengingly small branching fraction.
However, unlike the case with the charm quarks, the final state of two muons is easily identified by a clear experimental signature.
The result is that the $H\mm$ is the third and most challenging Higgs Yukawa coupling that is feasible to study at ATLAS.

The $H\mm$ coupling also provides a unique opportunity as both the $Hb\bbar$ and $H\tautau$ couplings are to third-generation fermions.
This means that the \hmm measurement adds a valuable point to the global picture of Higgs couplings, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:higgsMassCoupling}.
Measuring this coupling provides a test of the Standard Model and also insight into the nature of the muon's mass.

Detecting the decays of Higgs to two muons is particularly challenging on two counts.
First, the Higgs branching fraction to muons is tiny ($2.18\times10^{-4}$).
Second, there is a sizeable irreducible dimuon background from Drell-Yan and Diboson processes.
Together these evoke the idiomatic needle-in-a-haystack to describe the search for \hmm.
It is only with the enormous number of events collected by ATLAS during the Run 2 data-taking campaign that it became feasible to perform this search.

%%%%%%%%%%%%% VH #################3

Of particular interest in this thesis are Higgs bosons produced through the VH production mechanisms.
These mechanisms are listed in Table \ref{tab:higgsProdDiagrams} as Higgs-strahlung and gluon-originated ZH.
They result in final states with a Higgs boson as well as an associated \W or \Z vector boson.
These events offer both a chance to look at a new, unstudied phase space, as well as a contribution to the overall sensitivity in the search for \hmm.
The events where the vector boson decays leptonically are particularly useful.
The additional leptons help differentiate VH events from the Drell-Yan background and provide kinematic information for further discrimination.

The cross-section of WH is 1.36~pb in center-of-mass collisions with energy $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV, while the ZH cross-section is just 0.88~pb.

\begin{table}[htbp]
 \caption{Expected numbers of events from 139 fb$^{-1}$ $\sqrt{S}=13$ TeV data for WH and ZH. The first column shows the number of VH events, while the second column scales this by BR($H\to\mu\mu$) and the third column additionally multiplies by BR($V\to\ell\ell$) where $\ell$ is $e$ or $\mu$.}

V=\Z & 122,320 & 26.9 & 1.83 \\
\bottomrule\end{tabular}

\end{table}

Studying \hmm with VH produced events introduces several challenges and opportunities.
First the tiny VH cross-section produces relatively few events to study.
Second is the question of how to use the new information from the leptonic vector boson decay products to separate the background from diboson production processes.
This information is particularly important to remove diboson (ZZ and WZ) backgrounds.
% Techniques to address challenge
Careful choices are made in the selection criteria targeted at VH production in order to capture as many VH/\hmm events as possible.
A multivariate analysis (MVA) discriminant is used to take advantage of the kinematic information in the \W and \Z decays.
Steps must be taken to understand and to limit the level of bias that these techniques introduce to the results. 
This is necessary to avoid invalidating the final measurements.

The VH production mechanisms, WH and ZH, exemplified in Figure \ref{fig:vh-prod}, are the third and fourth leading Higgs boson production mechanisms at the LHC.
The cross-section of WH is 1.36~pb in center-of-mass collisions with energy $\sqrt{S}=13$, while the ZH cross-section is just 0.88~pb.
The cross-section, combined with the branching ratio of \hmm, results in the number of expected events per 139 fb$^{-1}$ shown in the first column of Table \ref{tab:vh-predict}.
In addition to the quark originating ZH shown in figure \ref{fig:vh-prod}, gluon originating ZH events contribute $\approx10\%$ to the total ZH cross-section.

The search for \hmm is conducted in several categories of phase space defined based on the kinematics of the event.
Two inclusive categories are defined first: a 4-lepton selection targeting ZH produced events and a 3-lepton selection optimized for WH produced events.
These target leptonic ZH events with $\mu\mu\mu\mu$ or $ee\mu\mu$ final states, and leptonic WH events with $\mu\nu\mu\mu$ or $e\nu\mu\mu$.
In the case of leptonic decays of the \W, only the charged lepton is reconstructed, while a neutrino may be inferred from the scale and direction of missing transverse energy \met.
A further set categories are derived from these inclusive categories.
In the case of the 3-lepton selection, two sub-selections are defined with high WH yields and low background yields.
In the case of the 4-lepton selection, one high purity sub-selection is defined.
The delimitation of these exclusive categories from within the inclusive selections is based on the MVA discriminant.
This MVA is a function that maps various kinematic variables calculated from each event onto a spectrum related to the likelihood that an event is produced by a VH mechanism. 
The search is performed in the dimuon invariant-mass spectrum across these two inclusive and three exclusive categories.
A combination is performed using an additional seventeen categories that target other Higgs production mechanisms listed in Table \ref{tab:higgsProdDiagrams}.
The observations of this analysis were made public in June 2020 \cite{atlasHmm}.
